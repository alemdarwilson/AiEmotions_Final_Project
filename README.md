<p align="justify">AiEmotions project presents an innovative approach to addressing the increasing importance of emotional well-being in today's digital world across all age groups.

The AiEmotions project aims to tackle this problem by introducing a novel approach that leverages artificial intelligence techniques for comprehensive emotion recognition and intervention.</p>

<p align="justify">AiEmotions seeks to provide a robust platform for individuals to monitor and manage their emotional states through regular collection of photo and video data. Utilizing advanced AI algorithms, the system analyzes this data to detect unusual emotional patterns and triggers appropriate actions, such as alerts, reports, and personalized recommendations for emotional well-being exercises.</p>
